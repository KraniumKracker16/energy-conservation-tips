This application has two parts: a back-end server (written in Java) and a front-end client (written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
The HTML/JavaScript code will be the UI that runs in the browser and communicates with the Java server to get data.

How to Run the Application in VS Code:
To run this application, you need to save both the Java and HTML code and then execute them in the correct order.
1. Open folder in VS Code (energy-conservation-tips)
2. Compile and Run the Java Server - Open a new terminal in VS Code (Terminal > New Terminal). Compile the Java code by typing the following command and pressing Enter:
javac EnergyConservationApp.java
Run the Java server with this command: java EnergyConservationServer
You should see a message in the terminal that says "Energy Conservation Server started on port 8000".
3. Open the HTML Client
With the server still running in the terminal, locate the EnergyConservationApp.html file in VS Code's file explorer.
Access the application by navigating to http://localhost:8000/ in your web browser.
